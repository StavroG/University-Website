# University Website

This is a project that was created for a Software Engineering class that I took in my senior year of college. In this project we created a website that would act as a universitie's online registration and registrar system. In this website you could register as a student or faculty account. With each account you would be able to do things appropriate to the type of user you are. For students you are able to register for classes, look at your previous classes and adjust your schedule. Faculty could do things like update their office hours and class times. Faculty could also add new courses and change students grades. 

All the data for this website was stored on a MySQL server on a Microsoft Azure server. 

The roles that I had in this project was Database Manager and Fullstack developer. I was responsible for setting up the Azure database and was also responsible for creating the SQL queries to upload and download information from the database. As the Fullstack developer I was also responsible for creating the front and backend of the website. I created the Login and Signup features as well as all the functionality for the faculty user.

### What I learend
* I learend how to program in PHP
* I learned how to host services on Microsoft Azure
* I learned how to connect to remote databases 
* I learend how to use JavaScript and CSS
* I learned how to use bootstrap as a way to rapidly develop prototypes
* I increase my understanding of MySQL

This project was hosted on Microsoft Azure, since the class has finished the database for this project is no longer up. If you would like to run this webstite your self localy, you would be able to do so. All you would need it to change the SQL server from the online Azure server to your server or a localhost. The website server itself is hosted with PHP so you would need to start a PHP server either on your localhost or with a hosting service.
